SMART TEXT EDITOR
=================

This project is a smart text editor/processor that incorporates “intelligent” behaviors of modern-day text interfaces including autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct. It also displays a readability score of the text using Flesch-Kincaid readability. The text editor also has other features including **Edit Distance** and **Markov Text Generator**.
